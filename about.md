I'm Kyle Simek, a research assistant in computer vision at the University of Arizona.  My research involves reconstructing 3D plant models from images using Bayesian inference.  In addition to computer vision, I'm also interested in machine learning, graphics, human-computer interaction, and augmented reality.  

I'm the co-author of Ergo, a C++ template library for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation and the author of cudcvt, a computer vision toolkit in CUDA.  You can see more of my work at the [code page](/code.html).
