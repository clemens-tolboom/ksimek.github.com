I'm Kyle Simek, a research assistant in computer vision at the University of Arizona.  My research involves reconstructing 3D plant models from images using Bayesian inference.  I love my research, because I get to study in so many different areas: 3D graphics, probability-theory, computational geometry, machine learning, image processing, high-performance computing, and plant-biology.  In addition to computer vision, I'm also interested in graphics, human-computer interaction, and augmented reality.  

I'm the co-author of Ergo, a C++ template library for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, and the author of cudcvt, a computer vision toolkit in CUDA.  You can see more of my work at the [code page](/code.html).

I've been programming since 1993, when I learned Apple HyperCard in fifth-grade.  As a high school sophomore, fate was kind to me: my AP Computer Science course switched their curriculum from Pascal to C++.  Over the course of my career, I've built projects in Java, C#, PHP, Python, Javascript and Matlab, but I'm happy to be "down to the metal" again, writing C and C++ code to churn out Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulations.

In my spare time, I play guitar in a rock band called, well, <em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Research/155179121234225?sk=app_2405167945">Research</a></em>, I destroy personal electronics in various interesting ways, and I sometimes build things, too.

I created this blog to share the oddball nuggets of wisdom I've acquired over the course of my research, things that I couldn't find in one place anywhere else on the internet.  I hope you find it useful!
