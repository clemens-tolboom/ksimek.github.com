This interactive toy shows how different camera parameters change the camera's geometry and how a scene is rendered.    This was originally built to supplement my upcoming articles exploring the intrinsic and extrinsic {% comment %} [intrinsic]() and [extrinsic](/2012/08/09/extrinsic) {% endcomment %} matrices; this is the standalone version.  For more on the perspective camea, check out my series of articles on the topic, "[The Perspective Camera, an Interactive Tour](/2012/08/13/introduction)".

This requires javascript and a [WebGL-enabled browser](http://caniuse.com/webgl).
