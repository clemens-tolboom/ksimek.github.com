Here you can read about the open-source software I've released.

Ergo
-------
[Ergo](https://github.com/ksimek/libergo) is a C++ template library for Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo that supports Gibbs Sampling, Metropolis Hastings, and Hybrid Monte Carlo.  

Cuda Computer Vision Toolkit
-----------------------------
[CUDCVT](https://github.com/ksimek/cudcvt) is a collection of computer vision routines implemented in CUDA.  Includes two novel edge-based likelihood functions: gaussian-mixture edge liklehoood, and the blurred-difference edge liklehood.

Other Stuff
-------------
* **[calcam.js](/js/calcam.js)** - A javascript implementation of a full 11-parameter perspective camera for [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).  This code is used in my [perspective camera toy](/perspective_camera_toy.html).
* **[elsd_to_polylines](https://github.com/ksimek/elsd_to_polylines)** - Generates polylines from the SVG file output by the [Ellipse and Line Segment Detector](http://ubee.enseeiht.fr/vision/ELSD/).
