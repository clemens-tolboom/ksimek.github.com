    Rotations
        non-transitivity of rotations
        Euler
            24 different conventions, no standard
            intrinsic vs. extrinsic
        inside-out applications
        Camera rotations vs. scene rotations - alibi vs. alias
        right-handed / left-handed
        row vs. column vector
        -1 determinant rotation matrix

    OpenCV & principal point
        1. opencv gives an intrinsic matrix that with center-origin
        2. display is bottom-right origin
        3. rotations look funny (interactive demo)
        4. Fix: convert between systems

    
Quaternions
    benefits of quaternions
    drawbacks
    conversion from quaternion to Matrix, euler, rodriquez and back again (links to algorithms)
        Key value: list of conversion algorithms and conversion matrix
